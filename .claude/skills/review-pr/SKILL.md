description: Handle automated PR review feedback and merge when ready
argument-hint: [pr-number]

Check GitHub Actions status, review feedback from automated reviewers (Code Rabbit,
Claude), implement or respond to feedback, and merge the PR when all feedback is
resolved.

The user provides:
- **PR number**: the pull request number to review (optional - infers from current branch)

## Workflow

### 1. Check GitHub Actions status

Use `gh pr checks <pr-number>` to see if automated reviews are complete.

**Important:** This command returns exit code 8 if any checks are pending, and
outputs them to stderr. Handle both stdout and stderr to capture all check statuses.

Output format: `check-name  status  duration  url`

**If any checks are still running (pending):**
- Report which checks are pending
- Exit with message: "GitHub Actions still running. Run this skill again when checks complete."
- DO NOT sleep or wait — let the user run the skill again later

**If checks failed:**
- Report which checks failed
- Show the failure URL from the output
- Exit and ask user to investigate

**If all checks passed:**
- Proceed to step 2 (fetch review comments)

### 2. Fetch review comments

**Important:** Inline review comments (the "tasks" users see in the GitHub UI)
are NOT returned by `gh pr view --json comments`. You must use the API directly:

```bash
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pr-number}/comments
```

This returns an array of review comment objects with:
- `path` — file path
- `line` / `start_line` — line numbers
- `body` — comment body (markdown, may include severity, suggestions)
- `html_url` — link to view the conversation
- `user.login` — reviewer (e.g., "coderabbitai[bot]", "claude-code[bot]")

**CodeRabbit comment format:**
- Body starts with severity: `_⚠️ Potential issue_ | _🟠 Major_` or `_🟡 Minor_`
- Includes suggested fixes in `<details><summary>Suggested fix</summary>` blocks
- May include committable suggestions between `<!-- suggestion_start -->` markers

Parse and categorize feedback by:
- Severity (Major, Minor, Info)
- File and line number
- Reviewer (CodeRabbit, Claude, human)

### 3. Present feedback summary

Show the user:
```
## PR Review Feedback Summary

### Pending conversations: X

1. **[Code Rabbit]** file.c:123
   > Suggestion: Use SDL_calloc instead of malloc
   [View conversation](https://github.com/...)

2. **[Claude]** README.md:45
   > Question: Should this mention the aspect ratio?
   [View conversation](https://github.com/...)

### Resolved conversations: Y
```

If no pending conversations, skip to step 6.

### 4. Handle each piece of feedback

For each pending conversation, ask the user:

```
Feedback from [Reviewer] on file.c:123:
> [feedback text]

How should I handle this?
1. Implement the suggestion (I'll make the code changes)
2. Respond and resolve (you explain why it's not applicable)
3. Skip for now (handle later)
```

Use AskUserQuestion with options:
- "Implement" - Make the code changes, commit, push
- "Respond and resolve" - Ask user for response text, post comment, resolve conversation
- "Skip" - Move to next feedback

### 5. After implementing changes

If any code changes were made:
- Stage changes
- Create commit: "Address PR feedback: [summary]"
- Push to the PR branch
- Re-run checks with `gh pr checks` (don't wait, just show status)
- Exit with: "Changes pushed. Run this skill again after checks complete."

**On next run after CodeRabbit re-reviews:**
- Check if comments are auto-resolved (CodeRabbit detects implemented fixes)
- If still unresolved after implementing the suggested fix:
  - Mention CodeRabbit in a comment: "@coderabbitai I've implemented your suggestion in commit ABC123. Can you verify and resolve this conversation?"
  - OR if CodeRabbit's check is complete (not currently running): "@coderabbitai Why hasn't this been auto-resolved? Is there an issue with my implementation?"
  - If CodeRabbit is still checking: wait for it to finish before asking

### 6. Check if ready to merge

Use `gh pr view <pr-number> --json reviewDecision,statusCheckRollup` to verify:
- All conversations are resolved
- All status checks pass
- PR has approval (reviewDecision = "APPROVED")

**If not ready:**
- Report what's blocking (conversations, checks, approval)
- Exit with instructions

**If ready:**
- Proceed to step 7

### 7. Merge the PR

Ask user for confirmation:
```
✅ All feedback resolved, all checks passing, PR approved.

Ready to merge PR #X: "Title"
Branch: lesson-03-uniforms-and-motion → main

Merge method:
1. Squash and merge (recommended for lessons)
2. Merge commit
3. Rebase and merge
```

After user confirmation:
```bash
gh pr merge <pr-number> --squash --delete-branch
```

Show success message with merged commit SHA.

## GitHub CLI commands reference

```bash
# Check PR status (returns exit code 8 if checks are pending)
gh pr checks <pr-number>

# Get inline review comments (the "tasks" shown in GitHub UI)
# IMPORTANT: This is the correct way to fetch review feedback
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pr-number}/comments

# View PR details (does NOT include inline review comments)
gh pr view <pr-number> --json reviewDecision,statusCheckRollup

# View specific workflow run
gh run view <run-id>

# Post a comment on a review thread
gh pr comment <pr-number> --body "response text"

# Ask CodeRabbit to verify/resolve after implementing a fix
gh pr comment <pr-number> --body "@coderabbitai I've implemented your suggestion in commit ABC123. Can you verify and resolve this conversation?"

# Resolve a review thread manually
# Note: GitHub CLI doesn't directly support this - may need gh api or manual UI resolution
# Usually let CodeRabbit auto-resolve when it re-reviews

# Merge PR
gh pr merge <pr-number> --squash --delete-branch
```

## Implementation notes

- **Never sleep or wait** — if actions are running, exit and tell user to re-run
- Can be run multiple times — each run picks up where it left off
- Commit messages for feedback changes should reference the PR number
- If Code Rabbit or Claude give conflicting advice, prioritize project conventions from CLAUDE.md
- Always show the user what will be changed before making code modifications
- Use the same commit message format as publish-lesson (with Co-Authored-By line)
- **The "X out of Y pending tasks"** shown in GitHub UI are the unresolved review comment threads—fetch them via `gh api repos/.../pulls/{pr}/comments`
- **CodeRabbit auto-resolution:** CodeRabbit automatically resolves conversations when it detects the suggested fix was implemented in a new commit. Let it auto-resolve; only ask it to resolve manually if it doesn't detect your fix after re-review.

## Error handling

- If `gh` CLI is not installed or not authenticated, provide clear setup instructions
- If PR doesn't exist, report error
- If branch has conflicts, report and exit (user must resolve manually)
- If merge is blocked by branch protection rules, report the blocking rules

## Example interaction

```

> NULL pointer.

How should I handle this?
[User selects: Implement]

How should I handle this?
[User selects: Respond and resolve]

Response: "Good catch! This is already mentioned in
the Key Concepts section at line 82. I'll resolve
this as a duplicate."

## Future enhancements

- Auto-detect if feedback is trivial (typos, formatting) and batch implement
- Learn from resolved conversations to avoid similar issues in future lessons
- Generate summary of what was changed for the PR merge commit message
