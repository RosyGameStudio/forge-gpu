# UI Lesson 11 — Widget ID System

FNV-1a hashed string IDs with hierarchical scope stacking — eliminating
manual ID assignment and the hidden collision problem.

## Result

![Widget ID System](assets/screenshot.png)

Two windows ("Audio" and "Video") each contain identically-labeled "Enable"
and "Verbose" checkboxes plus a "Delete" button. Scoped string IDs keep every
widget independent — toggling Audio/Enable has no effect on Video/Enable, and
pressing Delete##audio leaves Delete##video idle.

## What you'll learn

- **FNV-1a hashing** — the non-cryptographic hash function that converts
  string labels into `Uint32` widget IDs at virtually zero cost
- **`##` separator** — Dear ImGui's convention for separating display text
  from identity: `"Delete##audio"` displays "Delete" but hashes `"##audio"`
- **ID scope stack** — `forge_ui_push_id` / `forge_ui_pop_id` create
  hierarchical scopes so identical labels in different containers produce
  different hash values
- **Automatic scoping** — panels and windows push their own scope
  automatically, making accidental collisions unlikely in practice
- **Zero guard** — the hash function guarantees non-zero results, preserving
  `FORGE_UI_ID_NONE == 0` as the null sentinel

## Key concepts

- **FNV-1a hashing** — converts string labels to `Uint32` IDs with two
  operations per byte (XOR + multiply)
  ([The solution: hashed string IDs](#the-solution-hashed-string-ids))
- **`##` separator** — hides display text from the hash so widgets can share
  visible labels while keeping unique identities
  ([The `##` separator](#the--separator))
- **Scope stack** — `push_id`/`pop_id` chain parent seeds through nested
  containers, making identical labels in different scopes produce different IDs
  ([Hierarchical scope stacking](#hierarchical-scope-stacking))
- **Duplicate ID behavior** — when IDs collide, all widgets sharing that ID
  respond to hover, activation, and events simultaneously
  ([What happens when IDs collide](#what-happens-when-ids-collide))

## The problem with integer IDs

The previous system required callers to manually assign unique integer IDs to
every widget:

```c
/* Old API — caller must choose unique IDs */
forge_ui_ctx_button(ctx, 42, "OK", rect);
forge_ui_ctx_checkbox(ctx, 43, "Enable", &val, rect);
```

Worse, panels reserved `id+1` for their scrollbar and windows reserved `id+2`
for their collapse toggle.  These hidden reservations created **invisible
collision zones** — if a caller unknowingly picked an ID that collided with a
reserved internal ID, input would silently break.

Issue [#151](https://github.com/RosyGameStudio/forge-gpu/issues/151)
documented this exact bug: a checkbox with ID 102 collided with a window's
collapse toggle (also 102), causing the checkbox to fail.

## The solution: hashed string IDs

Widget labels now double as IDs, hashed automatically with FNV-1a:

```c
/* New API — labels ARE the IDs */
forge_ui_ctx_button(ctx, "OK", rect);
forge_ui_ctx_checkbox(ctx, "Enable", &val, rect);
```

### FNV-1a hash function

FNV-1a (Fowler-Noll-Vo) is a fast, well-distributed hash with a simple
implementation:

```c
Uint32 hash = seed;  /* 0x811c9dc5 at root scope */
for (const char *p = str; *p; p++) {
    hash ^= (Uint32)(unsigned char)*p;
    hash *= 0x01000193u;
}
```

The XOR-then-multiply structure produces excellent avalanche behavior — small
input changes affect many output bits — with only two operations per byte.

### The `##` separator

When two widgets need the same display text (e.g. two "Delete" buttons), the
`##` separator lets callers provide a unique suffix for hashing without
affecting what the user sees:

```c
/* Both display "Delete", but hash differently */
forge_ui_ctx_button(ctx, "Delete##audio", rect_a);
forge_ui_ctx_button(ctx, "Delete##video", rect_b);
```

The hash function finds the `##` separator and hashes only the portion
starting at `##`.  The display functions render only the text before `##`.

### Hierarchical scope stacking

Panels and windows automatically push a scope onto the ID stack, so widgets
with identical labels in different containers get different hashes:

```c
/* Audio window scope */
if (forge_ui_wctx_window_begin(wctx, "Audio", &audio_win)) {
    /* "Enable" hashes as FNV-1a("Enable", seed_from("Audio")) */
    forge_ui_ctx_checkbox_layout(ctx, "Enable", &audio_on, 28);
    forge_ui_wctx_window_end(wctx);
}

/* Video window scope */
if (forge_ui_wctx_window_begin(wctx, "Video", &video_win)) {
    /* "Enable" hashes as FNV-1a("Enable", seed_from("Video")) */
    forge_ui_ctx_checkbox_layout(ctx, "Enable", &video_on, 28);
    forge_ui_wctx_window_end(wctx);
}
```

The two "Enable" checkboxes produce different `Uint32` IDs because their
parent scopes differ.  No manual ID management is needed.

The scope stack supports up to 8 levels of nesting (window > panel > row >
widget), covering all practical UI hierarchies.

### What happens when IDs collide

If two widgets end up with the same `Uint32` ID — whether from identical
labels without scoping, a missing `##` suffix, or (rarely) an FNV-1a hash
collision — the hot/active state machine cannot distinguish them:

- **Both widgets highlight on hover.** The last widget drawn with the shared
  ID wins `next_hot`, but both compare `ctx->hot == id` as true, so both
  render in the hover style even though the cursor is only over one.
- **Both widgets activate on click.** When the user clicks one, `ctx->active`
  is set to the shared ID.  Every widget that checks `ctx->active == id`
  sees a match — a second button with the same ID also reports "pressed", a
  second slider also starts dragging, a second checkbox also toggles.
- **Both widgets fire events.** A button click returns `true` for every
  button sharing that ID, not just the one the user interacted with.

The result is **coupled widgets** — interacting with one silently drives all
others with the same ID.  The `##` separator and scope stacking exist to
prevent this.  If you see two widgets responding to a single click, a
duplicate ID is almost certainly the cause.

### Internal widget IDs

Panels and windows no longer reserve `id+1` or `id+2`.  Instead, they hash
descriptive internal names within their own scope:

```c
/* Inside window scope — \xff prefix prevents user-label collisions */
Uint32 toggle_id = forge_ui_hash_id(ctx, "\xff__toggle");
Uint32 sb_id     = forge_ui_hash_id(ctx, "\xff__scrollbar");
```

These names use a `\xff` byte prefix that cannot appear in user-typed
strings, preventing collisions with user-chosen labels.

## Diagrams

### ID collision — old vs new system

![ID Collision](assets/id_collision.png)

The old integer system created hidden collision zones with reserved offsets.
The new hashed system uses scoped string IDs that eliminate manual-ID and
reserved-offset collisions.  Hash collisions remain theoretically possible
for a 32-bit hash but are unlikely in practice for typical UI label sets.

### ID scope stack — hierarchical hashing

![ID Scope Stack](assets/id_scope_stack.png)

The scope stack chains FNV-1a seeds through nested push/pop operations. Each
scope level produces a new seed that mixes the parent's seed with the scope
name, ensuring unique hashes at every nesting level.

## Data output

This lesson's `main.c` produces the same vertex/index draw data format as
previous UI lessons.  The key difference is in how widget IDs are computed —
the draw data pipeline is unchanged.

Console output demonstrates the hash values:

```text
Audio/Enable  hash: 0xXXXXXXXX
Video/Enable  hash: 0xYYYYYYYY   (different from Audio/Enable)
Delete##audio hash: 0xAAAAAAAA
Delete##video hash: 0xBBBBBBBB   (different from Delete##audio)
```

## Building and running

```bash
cmake -B build
cmake --build build --target 11-widget-id-system
./build/lessons/ui/11-widget-id-system/11-widget-id-system
```

Output: 9 BMP images (`widget_id_frame_0.bmp` through `widget_id_frame_8.bmp`)
showing two windows with identically-labeled checkboxes operating independently.

## Exercises

1. **Custom scope**: Add a third window ("Network") with its own "Enable" and
   "Verbose" checkboxes.  Verify the hash values differ from both Audio and
   Video.

2. **Manual push/pop**: Use `forge_ui_push_id` / `forge_ui_pop_id` to create
   a custom scope outside of any window.  Place two sliders with the label
   `"##speed"` in different scopes and verify they operate independently.

3. **Hash collision search**: Write a test that hashes millions of random
   strings and counts FNV-1a collisions.  How does the collision rate compare
   to the theoretical rate for a 32-bit hash (birthday bound at ~77K items)?
