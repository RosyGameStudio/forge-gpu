/*
 * Engine Lesson 02 — CMake Fundamentals
 *
 * Demonstrates: Targets, properties, add_executable, target_link_libraries,
 *               target_include_directories, generator expressions, and what
 *               happens when the build configuration is wrong.
 *
 * This program is intentionally simple — the interesting part is the
 * CMakeLists.txt that builds it and the README that explains the concepts.
 * The code here exercises the build system features so you can see that
 * everything links and runs correctly.
 *
 * What this program proves when it runs:
 *   1. add_executable compiled both main.c and greeting.c (multi-source)
 *   2. target_link_libraries linked SDL3 (we can call SDL functions)
 *   3. target_include_directories found the common/ headers
 *   4. The generator expression copied SDL3.dll on Windows (no crash)

/* greeting.h is in the same directory as main.c.  The compiler finds it
 * because CMake's add_executable implicitly adds the source directory to
 * the include search path.  However, if we needed headers from another
 * directory (like common/), we would need target_include_directories. */
#include "greeting.h"

/* forge_math.h lives in common/math/, NOT in our source directory.
 * The compiler can only find it because our CMakeLists.txt has:
 *
 *   target_include_directories(02-cmake-fundamentals PRIVATE ${FORGE_COMMON_DIR})
 *
 * ${FORGE_COMMON_DIR} expands to the absolute path of the common/ directory.
 * PRIVATE means only this target uses that include path — other targets
 * that might link against us would not inherit it.
 *
 * If you remove that target_include_directories line and rebuild, you will
 * see an error like:
 *
 *   fatal error: 'math/forge_math.h' file not found
 *
 * That error means the compiler searched every directory on its include
 * path and could not find the header.  The fix: tell CMake where to look. */
