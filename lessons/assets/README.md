# Asset Pipeline Lessons

A hybrid Python + C track for building asset processing tooling — from a CLI
pipeline to a full asset editor with a web frontend.

## What you'll learn

- Scaffold a plugin-based CLI pipeline with TOML configuration (Python)
- Process textures: resize, compress, generate mipmaps, track changes (Python)
- Process meshes: deduplicate vertices, optimize indices, generate tangents and
  LODs using meshoptimizer and MikkTSpace (C tool invoked from Python)
- Generate procedural geometry: spheres, tori, capsules, and more from
  parametric equations (C header-only library)
- Pack processed assets into compressed bundles with random access
- Build a web frontend for browsing, previewing, and configuring assets
- Create a visual scene editor with undo/redo and live preview

## Result

The track produces a complete asset pipeline: a Python CLI that scans,
fingerprints, and processes raw art through plugins, backed by compiled C tools
for performance-critical mesh optimization and a header-only C library for
procedural geometry. Later lessons add a browser-based UI for asset browsing,
3D preview, and import settings.

## Key concepts

- **Python orchestrates, C processes** — The pipeline CLI is Python for rapid
  development and plugin flexibility. Performance-critical processing (mesh
  optimization, tangent generation) uses compiled C tools invoked as
  subprocesses. Procedural geometry lives in a header-only C library that GPU
  lessons include directly.
- **Incremental builds** — Only reprocess what changed. Fingerprint source
  files by content hash and skip unchanged assets.
- **Plugin architecture** — Each asset type (texture, mesh, scene) is a plugin
  that registers with the pipeline. New formats are added without modifying
  core code.
- **Metadata first** — Every processed asset has a sidecar file describing its
  source, settings, and output. The pipeline is fully reproducible.
- **Web-native tooling** — The frontend is a browser application served by
  an embedded Python server. No Electron, no native UI.

## Lessons

| # | Topic | Language | What you'll learn |
|---|-------|----------|-------------------|
| 01 | [Pipeline Scaffold](01-pipeline-scaffold/) | Python | CLI entry point, plugin discovery, asset scanning, content-hash fingerprinting, TOML configuration |

## Building

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+ (for pipeline CLI and web frontend)
- CMake 3.24+ and a C compiler (for mesh processing tools and procedural
  geometry library)
- pip (for installing Python dependencies per lesson)

Individual lessons may add dependencies (Pillow, Flask/FastAPI, meshoptimizer,
MikkTSpace) as needed — each lesson's README lists its requirements.

### Running

```bash
# Python lessons — from a lesson directory
pip install -r requirements.txt   # if present
python -m pipeline                # or as documented per lesson

# C tools — built via CMake alongside GPU lessons
cmake -B build
cmake --build build --config Debug
```

## Connection to other tracks

Asset pipeline lessons produce optimized runtime formats consumed by GPU
lessons. The mesh processing tool reads source glTF/OBJ files (using
`forge_gltf_load()` and `forge_obj_load()` during import) and writes optimized
binary output for fast GPU upload. The texture processing plugin generates
compressed, mipmapped textures ready for `SDL_CreateGPUTexture`. The procedural
geometry library (`common/shapes/`) provides parametric meshes used directly by
GPU and physics lessons.

| Track | Connection |
|---|---|
| GPU | Pipeline outputs feed directly into GPU lesson rendering; procedural geometry provides shapes for scenes |
| Engine | Build system concepts (incremental builds, dependency tracking) overlap; C tool compilation uses CMake |
| Math | Parametric surface equations build on vectors and trigonometry from math fundamentals |
| Physics | Procedural shapes (spheres, capsules, boxes) serve as collision proxies |

## Exercises

1. Add a new file type plugin to the pipeline scanner
2. Implement a texture atlas packing plugin that combines multiple textures
3. Write a mesh LOD export that produces multiple detail levels from one source
