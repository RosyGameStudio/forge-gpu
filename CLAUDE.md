# forge-gpu

A learning platform and building tool for real-time graphics with SDL's GPU API.

**Dual purpose:**

1. **Learn** — Guided lessons teaching GPU programming, math, and game techniques
2. **Forge** — Skills and libraries enabling humans + AI to build real projects

## Tone

Many users are learning graphics or game programming for the first time. When
answering questions or writing code:

- Be encouraging and patient — there are no dumb questions about GPU APIs or math
- Explain *why*, not just *what* — connect each concept to the bigger picture
- Use plain language before jargon; when jargon is unavoidable, define it
- Suggest alternatives gently rather than just correcting
- Reference specific lessons when relevant
- When using the math library, link to both the library docs AND the math lesson

### Lesson writing tone

Lessons teach real techniques backed by math and engineering — treat every
concept with the respect it deserves.

- **Banned words:** *trick*, *hack*, *magic*, *clever*, *neat* — these cheapen
  the material. Use instead: *technique*, *method*, *approach*, *insight*,
  *key idea*, *shortcut*, *property*, *observation*.
- **Be direct and precise.** State what a technique does and why it works.
  Avoid hedging phrases ("it turns out that", "there's a neat way to").
- **Credit named techniques** (Blinn-Phong, Gram-Schmidt) — they carry weight
  and help readers find more resources.
- **Explain reasoning, not magic.** "We use the transpose because rotation
  matrices are orthonormal" beats "there's a neat trick with the transpose."

## Code conventions

- **Language:** C99, matching SDL's own style conventions
- **Naming:** `Prefix_PascalCase` for public API (e.g. `forge_capture_init`,
  `ForgeCapture`), `lowercase_snake` for local/internal. The prefix is the
  module name (`forge_capture_`, `forge_math_`, etc.) — NOT `SDL_`, which is
  reserved for SDL's own symbols
- **Constants:** No magic numbers — #define or enum everything
- **Comments:** Explain *why* and *purpose* (every uniform, pipeline state, etc.)
- **Errors:** Handle every SDL GPU call with descriptive messages. **Every SDL
  function that returns `bool` must be checked** — log the function name and
  `SDL_GetError()` on failure, then clean up resources and early-return. This
  includes `SDL_SubmitGPUCommandBuffer`, `SDL_SetGPUSwapchainParameters`,
  `SDL_Init`, and others. Never ignore a bool return value.
- **Line endings:** Always use Unix-style (LF) line endings — never CRLF.
  The repository enforces this via `.gitattributes`.
- **Readability:** This code is meant to be learned from — clarity over cleverness
- **glTF assets:** Load entire models via `forge_gltf_load()` — never extract
  individual textures or meshes à la carte. Copy the complete model (`.gltf`,
  `.bin`, textures) into the lesson's `assets/` directory.
- **Builds:** Always run build commands via a Task agent with `model: "haiku"`,
  never directly from the main agent.

## Git workflow

- **Never commit directly to `main`.** All changes go through pull requests.
- Create a feature branch, commit there, push, and open a PR with `gh pr create`.
- Use the **/dev-publish-lesson** skill for lesson PRs — it handles branch + PR creation.
- **Batch all commits into a single push.** Never push commits piecewise (e.g.
  pushing a fix, then pushing a lint fix separately). Multiple rapid pushes
  cause CodeRabbit to freeze and pause reviews, delaying the entire PR. Make
  all local commits first, verify lint and builds pass locally, then push once.

## Testing

```bash
cmake --build build --target test_gltf   # build one test
ctest --test-dir build -R gltf           # run one test
ctest --test-dir build                   # run all tests
```

When modifying parsers or libraries in `common/`, always build and run the
corresponding tests. When adding a new module, add a matching test under
`tests/` and register it in the root `CMakeLists.txt`.

## Shader compilation

Shaders are written in HLSL and compiled to SPIRV + DXIL using
`scripts/compile_shaders.py`:

```bash
python scripts/compile_shaders.py              # all lessons
python scripts/compile_shaders.py 16            # lesson 16 only
python scripts/compile_shaders.py blending      # by name fragment
```

Generated files (`.spv`, `.dxil`, C headers) go in `shaders/compiled/`.
Headers are included as `"shaders/compiled/scene_vert_spirv.h"`. Recompile
after any HLSL change — the C build does not auto-detect shader changes.

## Writing lessons

### GPU lessons (lessons/gpu/)

- Start README with what the reader will learn, show result before code
- Introduce API calls one at a time with context
- **Use the math library** — no bespoke math in GPU code
- Link to relevant math lessons for theory
- **Use diagrams** — use **/dev-create-diagram** to generate matplotlib visuals
  for geometric, mathematical, or data-flow concepts. Never use ASCII art
  diagrams in lesson READMEs; proper diagrams are more readable and match the
  project's visual identity.
- End with exercises that extend the lesson
- Write a matching skill in `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`

### Engine lessons (lessons/engine/)

- Use **/dev-engine-lesson** skill to scaffold
- Focus on practical engineering: build systems, C, debugging, project structure
- Show common errors and how to diagnose them
- Cross-reference GPU and math lessons where relevant

### Math lessons (lessons/math/)

- Use **/dev-math-lesson** skill to scaffold + update library
- Small, focused program demonstrating one concept
- Add implementation to `common/math/` with extensive inline docs
- Cross-reference GPU lessons that use this math

### UI lessons (lessons/ui/)

- Use **/dev-ui-lesson** skill to scaffold
- Build an immediate-mode UI system — fonts, text, layout, controls
- **No GPU code** — lessons produce textures, vertices, indices, and UVs
- [GPU Lesson 28](lessons/gpu/28-ui-rendering/) renders the UI data on the GPU
- Add reusable types and functions to `common/ui/` as the track grows
- Cross-reference math lessons (vectors, rects) and engine lessons (memory,
  structs) where relevant

### Physics lessons (lessons/physics/)

- Use **/dev-physics-lesson** skill to scaffold
- Interactive 3D programs — simulation rendered in real time with SDL GPU
- Every lesson includes Blinn-Phong lighting, grid floor, shadow map, and
  camera controls as a rendering baseline
- Use simple shapes (spheres, cubes, capsules) — the physics is the focus
- Fixed timestep with accumulator pattern — physics must be frame-rate independent
- Support pause (Space), reset (R), and slow motion (T) in every lesson
- Add reusable physics code to `common/physics/` as the track grows
- Capture both screenshots AND animated GIFs (physics is dynamic)
- Cross-reference math lessons for vectors, quaternions, and integration theory

### Asset pipeline lessons (lessons/assets/)

- Use **/dev-asset-lesson** skill to scaffold
- **Hybrid Python + C track** — Python orchestrates, C handles performance-
  critical processing (meshoptimizer, MikkTSpace) and procedural geometry
- Python lessons are not added to CMakeLists.txt; C tool/library lessons are
- Plugin architecture — each asset type (texture, mesh, scene) is a plugin;
  C tools are invoked as subprocesses by the Python pipeline
- Procedural geometry lives in `common/shapes/forge_shapes.h` (header-only)
- Incremental builds with content-hash fingerprinting
- Later lessons add a web frontend (Flask/FastAPI + static HTML/JS)
- Cross-reference GPU lessons that consume the processed assets
- Cross-reference engine lessons for build system and dependency concepts

### Math library usage

GPU lessons and real projects should always use `common/math/`. When you need
a function that doesn't exist yet, use **/dev-math-lesson** to add it (creates
lesson + updates library + documents the concept).

## Skills

Skills in `.claude/skills/` are Claude Code commands that automate lesson
creation and teach AI agents the patterns from lessons. Users invoke with
`/skill-name` in chat. Claude can also invoke them automatically when relevant.

## Quality Assurance

### Markdown linting

All markdown is linted with markdownlint-cli2 (config: `.markdownlint-cli2.jsonc`).
Key rule: all code blocks MUST have language tags (`` ```c ``, `` ```bash ``, `` ```text ``).
Test locally: `npx markdownlint-cli2 "**/*.md"`

### Python linting

Scripts are linted with [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) (config: `pyproject.toml`).
Test locally: `ruff check scripts/ && ruff format --check scripts/`
Auto-fix: `ruff check --fix scripts/ && ruff format scripts/`

### CRITICAL: Never circumvent quality checks

Never disable lint rules, remove CI workflows, add ignore comments, or relax
thresholds to make errors pass. Always fix the underlying issue. If a rule
seems problematic, ask the user — don't bypass it yourself.

## Large file writes (MANDATORY — Task agent token limit)

Task agents hit a **32K output token limit** on Write calls. A single Write
producing ~800+ lines of C will fail silently — the file is never created and
all agent work is lost. This is a **fatal, unrecoverable error** that wastes
hours of planning and coding.

**MANDATORY rules — these are non-negotiable:**

1. **ALL GPU lesson `main.c` files MUST use the chunked-write pattern.** Do not
   attempt to write a full lesson `main.c` in a single Write call — ever. Split
   into 3-4 parts (~400-600 lines each), write each to `/tmp/`, then
   concatenate with `cat`.
2. **Every lesson PLAN.md MUST include a "main.c Decomposition" section**
   specifying what goes in each chunk before any coding agent starts writing.
3. **If a coding agent fails with a token limit error, NEVER write a fallback
   or simplified replacement.** STOP immediately and report the failure to the
   user. Writing a dumbed-down `main.c` destroys all the planning and coding
   work and forces the user to redo everything from scratch.
4. **Any file over ~800 lines** (README, `.c`, `.h`) must be written in chunks.

See [`.claude/large-file-strategy.md`](.claude/large-file-strategy.md) for the
full strategy, agent decomposition template, contract-sharing rules, and
recovery steps.
