# forge-gpu

A learning platform and building tool for real-time graphics with SDL's GPU API.

**Dual purpose:**
1. **Learn** — Guided lessons teaching GPU programming, math, and game techniques
2. **Forge** — Skills and libraries enabling humans + AI to build real projects

## Tone

Many users are learning graphics or game programming for the first time. Others
are building projects and hit a problem that requires deeper understanding.
Either way, when answering questions or writing code:

- Be encouraging and patient — there are no dumb questions about GPU APIs or math
- Explain *why*, not just *what* — connect each concept to the bigger picture
- Use plain language before jargon; when jargon is unavoidable, define it
- If a user's approach won't work, explain the reason gently and suggest an
  alternative rather than just correcting them
- Reference specific lessons when relevant ("this is the pattern from Lesson 02",
  "see lessons/math/01-vectors for the dot product explanation")
- Remember that getting a triangle on screen for the first time is a big deal
- When using the math library, link to both the library docs AND the math lesson
  explaining the concept

## Philosophy

**Learning enables building.** Understanding fundamentals makes working with AI
more productive. This project teaches graphics, math, and game techniques — then
provides reusable skills and libraries so humans and AI can build together.

### Learning (lessons/)
- Every line of code understandable by someone new to graphics/game dev
- Extensive comments explaining *why*, not just *what*
- Progressive curriculum: each lesson builds on the previous
- Topics: SDL GPU API, math fundamentals, rendering techniques, physics, etc.
- Math lessons are standalone (small programs demonstrating concepts)
- GPU lessons integrate math library (no bespoke math in GPU code)

### Forging (skills + libraries)
- **Skills** (.claude/skills/) — Reusable Claude Code skills distilled from lessons
- **Math library** (common/math/) — Documented, readable, learning-focused
- Every lesson produces a skill; AI agents learn the same patterns as humans
- Goal: Enable anyone to use Claude to build games and renderers confidently

### Code conventions
- **Language:** C99, matching SDL's own style conventions
- **Naming:** SDL_PrefixedNames for public API, lowercase_snake for local/internal
- **Constants:** No magic numbers — #define or enum everything
- **Comments:** Explain *why* and *purpose* (every uniform, pipeline state, etc.)
- **Errors:** Handle every SDL GPU call with descriptive messages
- **Readability:** This code is meant to be learned from — clarity over cleverness

### How it fits together
1. **Math lessons** teach concepts, add to `common/math/`
2. **GPU lessons** use math library, refer to math lessons for theory
3. **Skills** automate lesson creation and teach AI agents the patterns
4. **Math library** is reusable in any project (lessons or real builds)

## When writing GPU lessons (lessons/gpu/)
- Start each README.md with what the reader will learn
- Show the result (screenshot) before diving into code
- Introduce API calls one at a time with context
- **Use the math library** for all math operations — no bespoke math in GPU code
- Link to relevant math lessons when explaining concepts
- End with exercises that extend the lesson
- **Also write a matching skill** in .claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md that
  distills the lesson into a reusable Claude Code skill: YAML frontmatter
  with name and description, then the key API calls, correct order, common
  mistakes, and a ready-to-use code template

## When writing math lessons (lessons/math/)
- Use the **/math-lesson** skill to scaffold lesson + update library
- Small, focused program demonstrating one concept clearly
- README explains the math, the intuition, and where it's used in graphics/games
- Add the implementation to `common/math/` with extensive inline docs
- Cross-reference GPU lessons that use this math
- Keep it readable — this code is meant to be learned from

## Using the math library (common/math/)

**In your code:**
```c
#include "math/forge_math.h"  // Or whatever we name it

vec3 position = vec3_create(0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f);
mat4 rotation = mat4_rotate_z(angle);
```

**When to use existing math:**
- GPU lessons should always use the math library
- Real projects building with forge-gpu should use it too
- Reference the math library README and relevant lessons for documentation

**When to add new math:**
- You need a function that doesn't exist yet
- Use **/math-lesson** skill (invokable by humans or Claude automatically)
- This creates: math lesson + updates library + documents the concept
- Even simple operations deserve a lesson (dot product, normalize, etc.)

## Using skills (.claude/skills/)

Skills are Claude Code commands that teach AI agents patterns from lessons.

**Available skills:**
- **/math-lesson** — Add a math concept (lesson + library update)
- **/new-lesson** — Create a new GPU lesson
- **/publish-lesson** — Commit and PR a completed lesson
- **/sdl-gpu-setup** — Scaffold SDL3 GPU application
- And more — see `.claude/skills/` directory

**How they work:**
- Users invoke with `/skill-name` in the chat
- Claude can also invoke them automatically when relevant
- Each skill knows the project conventions and generates correct code
- Skills are themselves documented and maintainable

**For Claude:** When you need to add math functionality, use the /math-lesson
skill. When creating GPU lessons, ensure they use the math library and reference
math lessons for theory.

## Dependencies
- SDL3 (with GPU API)
- CMake 3.24+
